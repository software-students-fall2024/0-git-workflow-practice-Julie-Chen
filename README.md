With the growing use of AI, our careers and academics have drastically changed. On one hand, AI can enhance productivity and access to information. On the other hand, as this article demonstrates, it also introduces risks, particularly concerning the authenticity and integrity of academic work. It seems like the varying degrees of acceptance of AI in academic spaces reflect broader societal struggles with embracing and regulating new technologies. It is interesting—and a bit concerning—how these tools, while promising to streamline and innovate, also pose substantial threats to established systems.

## Comments
The article points out that generative AI is increasingly being used to create fake scientific papers, especially in sensitive areas like health, environment, and computing. These papers often appear alongside legitimate research on platforms like Google Scholar, raising serious concerns about the potential for misinformation and manipulation in academic fields. This highlights the need for stricter regulations and better detection methods to maintain the credibility of academic resources. - Toshi Troyer

*I didn't know that AI had huge implications for the scientific community. How will be able to verify scientific papers in the future? Hopefully there will be major oversight for this* - Madison Phung

Aneri Shah (anerivs):
I never thought of research papers now being written by Generative AI. Definitely something to watch out for. Hopefully Google Scholar can implement some quality control measures in the future to safeguard against AI-generated research and manipulated data.
